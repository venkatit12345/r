Data Types

Variables can hold values of different data types. Python is a dynamically typed language hence we need not define the type of the variable while declaring it. The interpreter implicitly binds the value with its type.

Python enables us to check the type of the variable used in the program. Python provides us the type() function which returns the type of the variable passed.

A=10  
b="Hi Python"  
c = 10.5  
print(type(a));   
print(type(b));   
print(type(c));
